Project 0000

- About:
    This is a revamped 6-axis robotic manipulator aimed to handle weights in excess of 10kg with ease. This manipulators construction/design/trouble-shooting will be throughly documented here on 
        Github, on Youtube, and on our website. This will be using NEMA 14 and NEMA 17 stepper motors for each one of the 6-axis of movement. 

- Requirements:
    - 6-axis of movement: Base rotation / Tilt 1 / Tilt 2 / Tilt 3 / Twist on claw / claw
    - Constrolled by a custom designed control board based on the Raspberry Pi Pico
    - Custom firmware written in C/C++ (research needing to be done for this)
    - Flexibility in required function
    - Modularity / Ease to repair

- Timeline: 
    Since I am an active college student, this project will be a do-as-I-please project. Meaning there is no deadline.
